### 题记
重建项目后终于找到了问题，我错误的使用了node-sass的配置，不过好在本配置已经保存。自此，我会将本文件作为开发
文档，记录学习中的困惑与问题。

After rebuilding project, I finaly found my fault that I shouldn't use node-sass as config. The 
better notice is that I save the right config. From now on I will use this file as a developing
document, to log the puzzles and notes.

至今，我终于弄明白了我之前新建版本为何与教学模板不一致。我弄错了配置。之后应该不会走弯路了。

我将vscode的全局编码格式改为了utf-8，于是又引发了一些冲突。重温了vue框架的第一节课，知道了项目的基本框架，
"assets"中应存放非vue资源。了解了vue中的注释方式以及一些细节问题。将npm的操作记录了下来，并写在了"README"
中，我打算将其作为笔记。

出了些问题，同样的代码没有产生同样的效果，我需要上网查查。

Until now ,I finaly understood the reason why my new-built code was not same as the teaching one.
I have changed the config. I think I will never make fault.

I changed the default encoding to "utf-8",so some conflict happened.Review the first lesson of vue
frame,and understand the basic frame,such as putting the other assets in "assets".Begain to know the
annotations ways and some detailed points.I took some notes about the operations of npm,and write it
in "README".
